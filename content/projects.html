         <h4 class="media-heading">The CitizenWeb Project</h4>
         The CitizenWeb Project is a mission to fight for a free, open, and above all a decentralized Internet. In order to achieve this, it aims to empower everyday internet users with the information and resources they need to take matters into their own hands. It provides news, features, guides and software to these ends. I am the Project's founder and editor.
