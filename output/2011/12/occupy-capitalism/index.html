  <h1>'Occupy' Capitalism: Rhetoric and Ideology in an Alienated Struggle</h1>

  <p>“As capitalism’s ever-intensifying imposition of alienation at all levels makes it increasingly hard for workers to recognize and name their own impoverishment, putting them in the position of having to reject that impoverishment <em>in its totality or not at all</em>, revolutionary organization has had to learn that <em>it can no longer combat alienation by means of alienated forms of struggle.</em>” - Guy Debord, <em>Society of the Spectacle</em></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Up until this point, the direct action of the Occupy movement has largely fallen in line with most similar expressions of so-called Progressivism we have seen over the past couple decades: that the objectives of so-called “predatory” capitalism are to be opposed by people. Marches have taken place against post-2008 criminals like Goldman Sachs, Chase, and Bank of America, denouncing a culture of corporate greed and demanding a more ethical alternative. “The American Dream has been sold off to the 1%,” protesters chant as they march festively toward the headquarters of whatever corporation did some bad thing recently, a seemingly endless and repetitive cycle.</p>

<p>The demands for a return to American Dream-style individual prosperity have been very prominent in the emerging “Occupy Our Homes” movement. This latest iteration of Occupy, dedicated to assisting those being evicted and foreclosed from their homes in forcibly keeping what is theirs, has been taking homes this winter in lieu of public places. This has been a welcome development, yielding an escalation in tactics, a path to direct populist communication, and a direct confrontation with the infallible institution of private property. But troubling signs of capitalist ideology have emerged in the rhetoric behind their actions. They desire nothing less than a return to the economic “normalcy” that the 1% has normatively determined: the American Dream for everyone. Everyone deserves to have an affordable home. Let’s all go back to the 90s, when things were going so well for us economically.</p>

<p>The rhetoric of capitalism is ever present, to the extent that, even when we can clearly identify our discontent with the system, we largely mistake individuals as the culprits, instead of the ever-present ideology that enabled them to act and enabled you to participate. The target should not be the group of individuals that is preventing you from acting out your capitalist-reinforced vision of “normal” life – the American dream, as it were – but instead that dream itself, based on false premises and a distorted idea of the fully-realized existence. Don’t bother with whatever oppressor is it today (is it Goldman Sachs? Perhaps Chase? If we don’t have a named shiny office tower to march on, how will we actualize our discontent?). Bother with the institution of oppression itself – that is, capitalism – and its rhetoric and ideology that is imposed on you, even through your own social movements.</p>

<p>This oppression is clearly evident in the rhetorical basis for the Occupy Our Homes movement, and others that seek a return to the violence of what we consider our economic “normalcy.” There is a difference between the American Dream of home ownership and the individual human right to adequate shelter. By claiming a <em>right</em> for every person to the American Dream of owning a house, consuming as much as we like, the ability to get ahead if we are willing to compete with others, etc., we use capitalist language to explain a very anti-capitalist desire: for example, the idea that humans have a “right” to adequate shelter would ideally preclude people being able to make money off of its scarcity! We are against what we deem as “unjust” evictions and foreclosure but do we really accept the idea of a “just” foreclosure? We are against economic violence when it is waged between the 1% and the 99%, but we are fine with the economic violence conducted every day under globalization, simply because we are Americans and thus deserve a return to our better standard of living? Make no mistake, these are results of capitalism itself, and it shows through the language that informs our self-actualization. When we use capitalist rhetoric to try to define our normative “rights,” it is inaccurate at best, and it fundamentally alienates the alternatives that we are trying to propose.</p>

<p>Of course, the rhetoric betrays the existence of capitalist ideology which permeates the movement. If Occupy succumbs to this ideology it invokes without confronting it in a meaningful way, it risks becoming a purely alienated struggle. The word “Occupy,” then, does not represent revolutionary or systemic change; but taking the wheel back from the hijackers and keeping the plane intact. The word “Occupy” then denotes a deliverance from one form of behaviour to another slightly ameliorated version of itself, with full popular support and authorization. Like the bourgeois revolution in France, or perhaps even state capitalism under Stalin, it names an enemy, expels them, yet keeps the flawed system and ideology intact. It’s the same as deriding “corporatism” without recognizing it as the logical conclusion of the larger problem of capitalism. It occupies space, but not ideology. Therefore, the alternative to occupying space as an open and solitary rejection of capitalist ideology is the empty and alienated “Occupation” of capitalism, an expression of reform and resignation, a desire for a “capitalism with a human face.”</p>

<p>The direct actions taken by the Occupy movement over the course of the past few months, especially in this latest phase of Occupy Our Homes, are truly important developments worth watching and participating in. But without a clear rejection of not only the symptoms of capitalism but also its roots in <em>our</em> ideology, the Occupy movement cannot become a truly meaningful instance of proletarian expression. Occupying our homes without <em>really</em> knowing why we are doing it – and stating it clearly – is an empty and alienated act. Alienated struggles can never effectively combat our own alienation. As Guy Debord might have said, the ideological basis of the Occupy movement should be easily derived: reject your impoverishment in it’s totality, or else you don’t reject it at all.</p>
