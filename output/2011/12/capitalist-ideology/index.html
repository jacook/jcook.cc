  <h1>On Capitalist Ideology</h1>

  <section class="byline">
  <p>Posted 15 December 2011 on <a href="/tags/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="/tags/capitalism" rel="tag">capitalism</a>, <a href="/tags/ideology" rel="tag">ideology</a>, <a href="/tags/rhetoric" rel="tag">rhetoric</a>, <a href="/tags/philosophy" rel="tag">philosophy</a></p>

  <p><strong>What is “capitalist rhetoric?”</strong></p>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric">Wikipedia</a>:
	<strong>Rhetoric</strong> is the art of discourse, an art that aims to improve the facility of speakers or writers who attempt to inform, persuade, or motivate particular audiences in specific situations.</p>

<p>Capitalist rhetoric is the use of capitalist constructions and conventions. It is pervasive in political discourse, even when attempting to articulate disagreement or opposition to capitalist systems.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Capitalist rhetoric is the wedge that produces alienated struggle from proletarian discontent. It does this by withholding the language with which we need to accurately articulate our struggle. Occupy appears as a rejection of the status quo on its face, but it remains alienated as long as it cannot effectively “recognize and <em>name</em> its own impoverishment.” We understand that we are the 99%, and that we are being negatively effected by economic forces somewhere, but why can’t we move past a focus on the individual 1%ers and instead target the ideology that enables them? This is because true capitalist exploitation is rendered invisible to the many through pervasive capitalist competition and consumption, and the rhetoric it produces. This exploitation is taken as being natural, and as such, we cannot even recognize it. This jibes with Debord’s idea of the Spectacle as a series of images through our social relationships and engagements occur. Marx’s “they don’t know it, but they are doing it” comes to mind as well.</p>

<p>Once meaningful (non-capitalist) rhetoric is removed from our struggle, it becomes “alienated” as it is now essentially meaningless. This is what I meant by “Occupy” — a movement that has been separated from meaningful anti-capitalist (truly “free”) discourse, and is instead clamouring merely for freedom to participate in the capitalist system equitably. If you don’t Occupy to reject exploitation through property (using the real definition of the word occupy), you are then seeking to “Occupy” the existing system of property yourself as a member of the exploiting caste. Like the airplane analogy I used in the last post, you are taking the wheel back from the hijackers, yet keeping the plane intact on its course toward the ground.</p>

<p><strong>How does ideology make capitalist exploitation invisible?</strong></p>

<p>To fully answer this question would require us to define the operations of ideology in a greater capacity. We obviously won’t get too deep into it, but the following quote gives us a glimpse:</p>

<pre><code>The operation of ideology in human life basically involves the constitution and patterning of how human beings live their lives as conscious, reflecting initiators of acts in a structured, meaningful world. Ideology operates as discourse, addressing or, as Althusser puts it, interpellating human beings as subjects. (Göran Therborn)
</code></pre>

<p>This “patterning of how [we] live our lives” is performed by ideology, and by far the dominant ideology of our time is that of capitalism. It addresses everything, from how we perceive our position in society all the way down to our own modes of self-actualization.</p>

<p>It’s hard to know something is stuck in your teeth until someone tells you (or if someone gives you a mirror). So it is with capitalist ideology. It is difficult to recognize because it is ingrained in the patterning of how we live our lives. The “structured, meaningful world” is made so by capitalist phenomena like competition, exploitation, vertical hierarchical structures, etc. It is reinforced by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_Spectacle#Mass_media_and_commodity_fetishism%22">Spectacle</a> of consumption and marketing that further embeds the features of this ideology into our conscious.</p>

<p>This is what people mean when they say that “capitalism withholds the language with which we need to <em>accurately</em> articulate our struggle.” Žižek explains this well with <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=N4ZOTlBZieoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=zizek%20welcome%20to%20the%20desert%20of%20the%20real&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">the missing ink joke</a>, and it is spot on. We don’t readily have language to confront (or identify) capitalism in its totality, because we are so used to accepting the ideology of capitalism as the normal background noise of our lives.</p>

<p><strong>How exactly does using capitalist rhetoric and ideology alienate our opposition to capitalism?</strong></p>

<p>Because we accept the terms of capitalism if we use its language in normative discourse. And if we accept the terms of capitalism through the language we use, than we obviously cannot critique it effectively as a social. Where this becomes significant, and enters the realm of ideology, is in our conditioning to accept things like competition, property, wage labour, and other forms of capitalist social organization as natural or ideal. The word ‘natural’ can get you in deep shit if you don’t understand what it means.</p>

<p>Using these ideas in your normative discourse (and therefore implicitly accepting them) alienates your opposition by accepting part of the philosophy that is enslaving you, i.e. capitalism. This is what Debord meant when he said we are put in the position of “having to reject our impoverishment in its totality, or not at all.” If our problems come from capitalism, we cannot accept capitalist ideas in our normative discourse, or else we are not solving our problems.</p>

<p><strong>How can we see this phenomenon manifest itself in Occupy and other social movements?</strong></p>

<p>I mentioned the calls to return to the “American Dream” that we hear from Occupy Our Homes in a prior post. This accepts the premise that “if you work hard enough, you can get ahead.” You can talk about our lack of social mobility until the cows come home, but you won’t be able to address it effectively if you accept the ideology of the capitalist’s ‘merit’ to property.</p>

<p>We can also see it in the movement’s discourse against wealth inequality. Why do we criticize the huge amounts of money that bankers get paid, without addressing the ideology behind what enables such actions to take place? Because through the rhetoric of “they <em>should</em> be more wealthy because they’ve accomplished so much,” we accept the idea that labour value appropriation by capitalists is either natural or ideal.</p>

<p>Why do we criticize banks individually for trying to hoard as much cash as they can, and for trying to pay as few taxes as they can? The system of ‘maximizing profit and minimizing expense’ is central to capitalism, and as long as this exists in the realm of capitalist competition, businesses will have to participate in this way or else they will not survive. If we accept this in our rhetoric and simply say that “corporations must pay their fair share,” than we are not rejecting our impoverishment in its totality.</p>
