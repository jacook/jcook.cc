  <h1>The London Riots as Full Spectacular Participation</h1>

  <p>Explaining the socio-economic context surrounding the development of today’s post-crisis “information” economy, and the cult of the iPad and other modern commodities, is crucial for an accurate understanding of today’s world. The West is jobless and driven into debt; what hope at further prosperity do they have, except to buy what they can with however much they can scrape together? And the ones that cannot scrape enough together, well, they are the ones who will act out.</p>

<p>In the days following the London Riots of 2011, many commentators criticized those who would lament the condition of the urban youth there. Nearly all talk of possible socio-economic causes for the unrest was criticized as “over-the-top” and unthinkable. When Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London, stated (quite rightly) that the recent austerity drive by Britain’s Conservative Party might have exacerbated the situation, he was accused of “crass political opportunism” and insensitivity.<a name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Yet what drove those “nihilistic and feral teenagers,” as the Daily Mail called them, to wantonly break, loot, and steal? What impulse is at the root of the desire to organize and take matters into one’s own hands? Two distinct forces can be identified here, and the cult of Apple as mentioned earlier plays an important role in one of them.</p>

<p>The esteemed professor David Harvey perhaps said it best when he explained that the London rioters were only “doing what everyone else [was] doing, though in a different way.”<a name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Chaotic participation in the Spectacle of consumer capitalism is often difficult to distinguish from the authentic rioting and looting. The masters of marketing at Apple taunt us with their newest products constantly, informing us subtly that we are somehow incomplete without them, that we are “missing out” on authentic happiness if we don’t get the newest device as soon as we can, or that we are somehow inadequate, uncool, “square,” etc. without purchasing their newest option.<a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> When this is dangled in people’s faces, who can blame them for giving into temptation, or what some would even go as far as to call “incitement?” Those who can afford to buy the newest product (or have the credit limit) wait in line in front of big-box stores, bizarrely setting up tents and causing a fuss.<a name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> Others wait outside Wal-Marts on Black Friday, storming in and trampling anything in their way in order to get their hands on anything, everything, at a price they might hope to afford. And those who cannot afford them, what are they to do? As a society we have decided that it is important to keep sex offenders away from schools in case they are tempted to commit a crime, yet when we taunt the poor with advertisements of happiness and better lives that can only be had if they owned the newest commodity, is it really surprising that some are willing to loot for this opportunity?</p>

<p>Therefore we can identify the first force behind the Spectacular events of the London Riots as so-called “feral capitalism,” the encouragement to covet and desire commodities, handed down from marketing firms on high, and a participation in “envy masked as triumphant carnival.”<a name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> The second force is in understanding violence as the language of the exploited, the only meaningful way in which they feel they are able to participate in society, with dramatic physical action. As Slavoj Žižek wrote on the subject, “Opposition to the system can no longer articulate itself in the form of a realistic alternative, or even as a utopian project, but can only take the shape of a meaningless outburst. What is the point of our celebrated freedom of choice when the only choice is between playing by the rules and (self-)destructive violence?”<a name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> The political classes, not only in Britain but also in the majority of the Western world, have completely abandoned any notion of representing the poor, the oppressed, the worker, the proletariat, or what have you. They are instead preoccupied with the reactions of Wall Street, of Canary Wharf, of Frankfurt and of Singapore, all of whom are in constant crisis and in constant need of attention and support, lest the system come apart at the seams. Confronted with this new reality, the only form of action that the socially-ignored masses retain is that of violence and disruption, an act of defiance in the face of a brutally oppressive system. <a name="_ftnref7" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>

<p>Hence we have the burning of furniture stores and other forms of large-scale lawlessness that we saw in London last year: it only started with a spark of energy after the Metropolitan Police’s killing of Mark Duggan, but took days to ignite into full-blown chaos. Once the anger became a Spectacle, it was irresistible to participate in it. Even in the much smaller (and much more trivial) Vancouver riots of the same year, in which angry middle-class youth took to the streets to protest the Canucks losing a hockey match, we saw hundreds rolling police vehicles and smashing up storefronts – why? Because the initial spark of violence represented the only way they could act out the disappointment and anger they felt after their team lost a hockey match. After that point, involvement in the Spectacle was irresistible. And this sort of behaviour is precisely what capitalism perpetuates and incites.</p>

<p><a name="_ftn2" href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a> David Harvey, “Feral Capitalism Hits The Streets,” <em>Reading Marx’s Capital with David Harvey (Blog)</em>, 11 Aug 2011, <a href="http://davidharvey.org/2011/08/feral-capitalism-hits-the-streets/">http://davidharvey.org/2011/08/feral-capitalism-hits-the-streets/</a> (accessed 25 Feb. 2012).</p>

<p><a name="_ftn3" href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a> See the “Mac vs. PC” ads as an example. Try to watch one and analyze what sort of marketing techniques are employed. The result is easy to see – those who are “smart” enough to buy Apple products are hip and desirable, but those poor PC owners…</p>

<p><a name="_ftn4" href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a> One anecdote circulating among Occupy Wall Street participants last November was that people were setting up tents and camping in front of stores to get good positions on Black Friday sales – pictures of these events were passed around Occupation sites with the captions “What are their demands?! Why do they Occupy?” The real sadness in this joke is that those participations in Spectacular “feral capitalism” are supported and encouraged, while those camping out and protesting in authentic demonstrations of discontent are criminalized and silenced.</p>

<p><a name="_ftn5" href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a> Slavoj Žižek, “Shoplifters of the World Unite,” <em>London Review of Books</em>, 19 Aug 2011, <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/2011/08/19/slavoj-zizek/shoplifters-of-the-world-unite">http://www.lrb.co.uk/2011/08/19/slavoj-zizek/shoplifters-of-the-world-unite</a> (Accessed 26 Feb. 2012).</p>

<p><a name="_ftn6" href="#_ftnref6">[6] </a>Ibid.<strong></strong></p>

<p><a name="_ftn7" href="#_ftnref7">[7]</a> An interesting observation is to see this second force in conjunction with the first – violence of this nature was so surprising to Londoners (and Vancouverites) that photos of youth throwing shopping carts through Starbucks windows were passed around social networks like wildfire. News outlets and independent photographers sold their photos of the violence to media organizations, who in turn sold them back to the public through newspapers and online news sites. People were glued to their televisions, and live coverage of this event undoubtedly was terrific for ratings – and, by extension, advertising revenue. This is the true Spectacular singularity, as capitalism creates the Event, internalizes it, and commodifies it in one large cycle.</p>
