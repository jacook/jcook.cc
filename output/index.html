        <section class="snippet">
          <p>I’ve recently replaced my old WordPress setup with a static site generator called nanoc. For those that don’t know, a static site generator can use automated rules to create simple HTML pages based on the input you give it. These pages can be translated from an easy-to-write language like Markdown, making blogging with a static site generator very easy. It is also gaining popularing among “lightweight” bloggers like myself that don’t require complicated search functions, PHP scripts or other slower and exploitable technologies. Its resulting simplicity is its greatest feature.</p>

<p>I will walk you through the features and functions of the custom framework of nanoc that I’ve created to easily host a functional blog. This framework is called KnockKnock.</p>

        <section class="snippet">
          <p>Once you have your self-hosted Tent server installed, you will need a way to interact with it – to send and receive messages, to add new followers and to view others’ profiles. The most useful (and universal) client available at this point is called TentStatus. TentStatus was developed by the tent.io team to provide a quick-start way for developers to start using Tent. We will set up an installation of TentStatus on our locally-managed server to provide us with individual access to all things Tent.</p>

        <section class="snippet">
          <p>The holidays are an interesting time of year. Most of us spend our time with our families, catching up with stories or photos from the year past. Whether we love our families or… just ‘like’ them, Christmas often reminds us that we are stuck with them for life, for better or for worse. This fact is reinforced when we open up our Facebook profiles (for those of us that have them). Facebook has now become a social obligation for many family relationships. But for the privacy-aware user, Facebook is literally the worst-of-the-worst when it comes to tracking, commercialism and most other forms of corporate douchebaggery. The absolute best way is to just get rid of the thing once and for all. But if we can’t get rid of our Facebook accounts due to social obligations, can we at least find a way to ‘tolerate’ it?</p>

<p>Here I will share how I use and configure my Facebook to be as minimally invasive as possible.</p>

        <section class="snippet">
          <p>Over the past few days I’ve been getting to know <a href="http://tent.io">the Tent project</a>. Tent is a protocol for sharing and storing data that has the potential to change the way we think about how social networks are presently organized and integrated. The present system of centralized control and access does a tremendous disservice to users, as I’ve articulated many times, and can actually be dangerous for those who use social networks for sensitive or political communication. So creating a truly decentralized yet truly interoperable social sharing system is key to addressing the biggest problems that face social networking today.</p>

        <section class="snippet">
          <ul>
<li>
<strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Assange, Jacob Appelbaum, Andy Müller-Maguhn, and Jérémie Zimmerman</li>
  <li>
<strong>Language:</strong> English</li>
  <li>
<strong>Genre(s):</strong> Non-Fiction; Technology (Cryptography, Freedom, Security), Communications, Philosophy</li>

<strong>Date of Publication:</strong> 2012</li>
</ul><!-- more --><p><strong>About the Book (Excerpt):</strong> <em>“Cypherpunks are activists who advocate the widespread use of strong cryptography (writing in code) as a route to progressive change. Julian Assange, the editor-in-chief of and visionary behind WikiLeaks, has been a leading voice in the cypherpunk movement since its inception in the 1980s. Now, in what is sure to be a wave-making new book, Assange brings together a small group of cutting-edge thinkers and activists from the front line of the battle for cyber-space to discuss whether electronic communications will emancipate or enslave us. Among the topics addressed are: Do Facebook and Google constitute “the greatest surveillance machine that ever existed,” perpetually tracking our location, our contacts and our lives? Far from being victims of that surveillance, are most of us willing collaborators? Are there legitimate forms of surveillance, for instance in relation to the “Four Horsemen of the Infopocalypse” (money laundering, drugs, terrorism and pornography)? And do we have the ability, through conscious action and technological savvy, to resist this tide and secure a world where freedom is something which the Internet helps bring about?”</em></p>

<p><strong>My review:</strong> I eagerly anticipated the release of this book. The chance to be a “fly on the wall” during a conversation of four of the world’s most influential “hackers” and internet activists doesn’t happen everyday. And that is exactly what we are presented with in <em>Cypherpunks.</em> The book plays out in conversation format, with Julian Assange, Jacob Appelbaum, Andy Müller-Maguhn and Jérémie Zimmerman discussing their own points of view regarding the state of the Internet and the role of government in today’s always-connected society. They each bring their own interesting perspective to the table during the discussion. Reoccurring themes in the book include the encroaching and totalizing force of social networking, the extent of government surveillance programs, and (of course) the threat that organizations like WikiLeaks pose for those in power.</p>

<p>This book presents us with a “crossroads moment” in the advancement of our technology. The concentration of vast amounts of information by unaccountable corporations like Google and Facebook pose a danger in themselves. However the book highlights the very real problem of “bulk interception” – governments capturing <em>all</em> data communicated on certain channels and storing it for later use. The capability for bulk interception is very new, and coupled with the fact that we are sharing more information more publicly than ever, there is tremendous cause for concern that common individuals might be targeted for nothing more than using their right to free speech (<em>“Ten years ago this was seen to be a fantasy, this was seen to be something only paranoid people believed in, but the costs of mass interception have now decreased to the point where even a country like Libya with relatively few resources was doing it with French technology”</em>). Furthermore, many communications systems and social networking platforms are based in the United States, they are subject to the United States government law, and ultimately, its physical control. Laws governing the privacy of this information are loose and often simply ignored. Free communication and the exchange of political ideas online are also at risk from the resulting effects of censorship (<em>“They see the internet like an illness that affects their ability to define reality”</em>). Other important implications are studied, such as the risks posed to freedom of association and economic exchange.</p>

<p>I am very pleased to say that this book does not fall into the trap that so many “cypherpunks” and internet activists have fallen into before it: the libertarian fantasy. The never-ending dream within the tech community often focuses on the state as the sole enemy, and tells us that “If only we had a _truly _free market, the consumer would rule, and we would never have any problems with surveillance/privacy/etc.” This hogwash is largely avoided in this book. The merger of state and corporate power is given serious treatment, and the authors pull no punches when it comes to the role that unmitigated capitalism and economic exploitation play in the systematic infringement of rights. While the phrase “free market” is tossed around quite a bit – almost uncomfortably so – the authors make it clear that the “economic freedoms” they emphasize are not predicated on vertically-organized hierarchies of exploitation.</p>

<p>The four authors do an excellent job of exposing the present architecture of the Internet and modern communications, and demonstrating why every individual should be involved in changing it. Aside from the introduction, the book is not written in a polemic style, and it benefits from the clear and level-headed way in which the authors outline just what is at stake. But at the end of the book we are left with a bit of a black hole. Julian’s powerful statement in the introduction (<em>“Cryptography is the ultimate form of non-violent direct action”</em>) implies that we merely need to encrypt all of our information everywhere and that will somehow make the surveillance state stop trying… or something. I would like to have read more details about the potential alternatives to the present system. The book is short on specifics for actually encouraging change, both within the “hacker” and tech enthusiast community, and outside of it. There are mentions of some possible actions, like working for more decentralized Internet architectures, however this book is more focused on large-scale demonstrations of “where we are now” rather than how we can get to where we need to be.</p>

<p>That being said, I found <em>Cypherpunks</em> to be a very enjoyable and enlightening read. Even though I do not consider myself a layman in the subjects the book presents, I learned quite a bit by reading it. Most of the book is presented in a way that is easy to read and understand, naming and explaining all the acronyms and references that come up for those who may not be as well-versed in the subject matter. I would recommend <em>Cypherpunks</em> to any political or tech activist interested in learning what the new wave of communications – both for better and for worse – could look like.</p>

<hr><p><strong>Notable Quotes</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jérémie Zimmerman on the “dumbing down” of technology:</strong> “<em>I see a difference with what we describe as the spreading of technology, because in the case of the mill and the printing press you had to look at one to understand how it works, whereas now we are increasingly building control inside the technology. The control is built-in. If you look at a modern computer in most cases you cannot even open it to get to know all the components. And all the components are in small cases—you cannot know what they are doing… [Free software/hardware] can contain the function to monitor the user and its data. This is why free software is so important for a free society.</em>”</p>

<p><strong>Jacob Appelbaum on oversharing with Facebook:</strong> <em>“It’s absolute madness to imagine that we give up all of our personal data to these companies, and then the companies have essentially become privatized secret police. And—in the case of Facebook—we even have democratized surveillance. Instead of paying people off the way the Stasi did in East Germany, we reward them as a culture—they get laid now. They report on their friends and then, ‘Hey, so and so got engaged;’ ‘Oh, so and so broke up;’ ‘Oh, I know who to call now.’“</em></p>

<p><strong>Julian Assange on why leaving privacy issues to politicians isn’t the only solution:</strong> “<em>You can have your democratic victories that take place in public, on the surface, but underneath things are still done anyway. Which is to show that I don’t think that policy or legislative reform is the way; although you can’t give the opponent a free kick either, because then they just accelerate. So it is important to check them in various ways, as ACTA is being checked. It slows them down. But even a win in parliament in relation to legislation doesn’t stop this below the surface activity.</em>”</p>

<p><strong>Jacob Appelbaum on the morals of social networks:</strong> <em>“This isn’t about technology at all, it’s about economics. They have decided that it is more important to collaborate with the state and to sell out their users and to violate their privacy and to be a part of the system of control—to be paid back for being a part of the surveillance culture, to be part of the culture of control—than to be resistant to it, and so they become a part of it. They’re complicit and liable.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Andy Müller-Maguhn on the endgame:</strong> “<em>We have to stick to our own infrastructure, that’s the important thing to learn here—that if we want to oppose the surveillance state, the one Big Brother, we have to study what that is, whether it is indeed a linking of central states that say, “Hey, if we combine we can gain even more.” And we need to know what our role is here—our role is to keep decentralized, have our own infrastructure, not rely on cloud computing and other bullshit, but have our own thing.</em>”</p>

<p><strong>And finally, Jacob Appelbaum on the benefit that cryptographic security can provide for free speech:</strong> “<em>The force of nearly all modern authority is derived from violence or the threat of violence. One must acknowledge with cryptography no amount of violence will ever solve a math problem.</em>”</p>

        <section class="snippet">
          <p>News came out yesterday that the City of Munich in Germany <a href="http://www.itworld.com/operating-systems/321474/switching-linux-saves-munich-over-11-million?page=0,0">has saved big while moving to Linux</a>. The City migrated 11,000 users from Windows 2000 to a custom Linux distribution for €22.8 million, which also included a full switch from Microsoft Office to OpenOffice. The projected costs of a migration to Windows 7 and Microsoft Office for the city ran to €34 million, giving the government a tidy savings of €11 million. The migration will continue to more systems running proprietary software over the course of the next few years. For a relatively modest-sized city of nearly 1.4 million people, this savings is nothing to shake a stick at, and Munich has done a great job in taking the lead on such an ambitious project. It is of critical importance that governments - both national and municipal - be urged to consider making similar switches as soon as possible. This is not just important for controlling public expenses, but also for the important changes taking place in how our technology and data are managed.</p>

          <p><em>(<a href="http://occupywallst.org/article/quebec-fight-free-education-continues/">A version of this article I wrote appeared on OccupyWallSt.org on November 22nd, 2012.</a>)</em></p>

<p>If you listen to the mainstream media in Canada and Québec (or elsewhere), you could be forgiven for believing that Québec’s student movement is running on cold embers these days. After a historic and lively protest movement that saw hundreds of actions and hundreds of thousands of people in the street demanding an end to the continued neoliberalization of the education sector, a great victory was achieved when the newly-elected Parti Québécois promptly repealed the tuition hikes proposed by the former government. But this victory has proven to be far from the end of the story for Québec’s students, which inspired the world with their activism, and - strangely enough - brought banging pots and pans back in vogue.</p>

        <span class="date">20 November 2012</span> <a class="title" href="/2012/11/google-privacy/">'What's Wrong with Google?' Security, Safety and Rights on the Internet</a>
        <section class="snippet">
          <p>I should begin this post by saying that there is nothing <em>inherently</em> wrong with using and improving your life with an internet services platform like Google. Nor is there anything inherently wrong with using a Windows operating system. Or Apple products, for that matter. Billions of people around the world use these systems everyday without negative consequence. Their advancement has provided untold ability to learn and improve life for nearly everyone on the planet, that much is certain. The problem with services like Google lie in their newfound ubiquity, as well as their ability to store vast amounts of data on us - including details as personal as our <em>physical location</em> - with little to no external oversight. And our continued use of these services enable and affirm such moves, providing these services with the justification they need to continue on their privacy onslaught. Google’s success in propagating itself to every corner of our lives - with our full acquiescence - is the reason we should be so determined to resist it.</p>

<p>The questions here are simple: What fundamental responsibility do we have to our own information? What are our personal details, our meetings and writing, our entire lives that are now exceedingly being stored and lived on the internet, really worth to us? What rights do we really have when we use publicly-available services with privacy policies that are dozens of pages long? This is something that only each individual can decide for themselves. But these questions are only becoming more pertinent. As an incredible amount of our lives these days is lived on the Internet, it merits a very serious and sober look at just what we own and who we give it to for “safekeeping.”</p>

        <section class="snippet">
          <p>Explaining the socio-economic context surrounding the development of today’s post-crisis “information” economy, and the cult of the iPad and other modern commodities, is crucial for an accurate understanding of today’s world. The West is jobless and driven into debt; what hope at further prosperity do they have, except to buy what they can with however much they can scrape together? And the ones that cannot scrape enough together, well, they are the ones who will act out.</p>

<p>In the days following the London Riots of 2011, many commentators criticized those who would lament the condition of the urban youth there. Nearly all talk of possible socio-economic causes for the unrest was criticized as “over-the-top” and unthinkable. When Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London, stated (quite rightly) that the recent austerity drive by Britain’s Conservative Party might have exacerbated the situation, he was accused of “crass political opportunism” and insensitivity.<a name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Yet what drove those “nihilistic and feral teenagers,” as the Daily Mail called them, to wantonly break, loot, and steal? What impulse is at the root of the desire to organize and take matters into one’s own hands? Two distinct forces can be identified here, and the cult of Apple as mentioned earlier plays an important role in one of them.</p>

          <p>Yet as everything else crumbles around it, the inexorable march of capitalism soldiers on, doing the only thing it knows how to do. As modern life was dominated in the twentieth century by the factory and industrial economy, the twenty-first century has become subject to the computer and its “information” economy. Data is now bought and sold as a commodity. Children in the 1870s might have saved up their weekly allowances to purchase candy or dolls manufactured in a factory with traditional means; now we have progressed to the true commodity of this age: the “Pro Version.” Whether it’s for a new level in the Angry Birds game we play on our smartphones, or to unlock new and helpful features in our favourite calendar application, the Pro Version – i.e. the non-free App, the invisible and intangible commodity of “intellectual property” – is the commodity of the digital age. Of course, commodification at this level is not new, and while we might scoff at how useless paying ninety-nine cents is for an extra level of that time-wasting game on our phone, is it really any different than a child purchasing a ball-and-paddle in the 1800s?</p>

          <p><strong>What is “capitalist rhetoric?”</strong></p>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric">Wikipedia</a>:
	<strong>Rhetoric</strong> is the art of discourse, an art that aims to improve the facility of speakers or writers who attempt to inform, persuade, or motivate particular audiences in specific situations.</p>

<p>Capitalist rhetoric is the use of capitalist constructions and conventions. It is pervasive in political discourse, even when attempting to articulate disagreement or opposition to capitalist systems.</p>

          <p>“As capitalism’s ever-intensifying imposition of alienation at all levels makes it increasingly hard for workers to recognize and name their own impoverishment, putting them in the position of having to reject that impoverishment <em>in its totality or not at all</em>, revolutionary organization has had to learn that <em>it can no longer combat alienation by means of alienated forms of struggle.</em>” - Guy Debord, <em>Society of the Spectacle</em></p>

          <p>A remarkable thing happened several weeks ago in a small city in North Carolina. A group of Occupiers from Chapel Hill affiliated with the national movement, emboldened by similar actions by Occupiers in Oakland, California, reclaimed an old used car dealership that had sat vacant for years. The owner, a deadbeat who has been apparently at odds with city government for some time now, has kept the lot vacant and undeveloped for the better part of ten years. This large building and land, unoccupied and unused for a very long time, was converted to serve the interests of the people of Chapel Hill.</p>
