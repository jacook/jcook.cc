<p>Hello! My name is Jacob Cook. I am 25 years old and I currently live in Montréal, Québec, Canada. My areas of professional interest are systems administration, software programming, web development and writing/journalism.</p>

<p>I am the lead developer and project manager for <a href="https://arkos.io">arkOS</a>, a project designed to make self-hosting common Web services easy for the general public. I'm also the founder of <a href="https://citizenweb.io">CitizenWeb</a>: a project that advocates for a freer, more secure, and notably a more decentralized Internet for everyone, and provides technical and educational assistance to further these ends. My work on these projects has been featured in many leading media sites, such as VentureBeat, FastCompany, Der Spiegel, Heise and others.</p>

<p>I enjoy writing about political subjects, philosophy, the environment, and media studies. The blog on this site primarily serves as an outlet for hashing out my thoughts in these areas.</p>

<p>I attended Concordia University in the pursuit of a Bachelor of Sciences in Political Science and the French language. My other interests include photography, film and media studies, travelling, reading, and electronic music.</p>
