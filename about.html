<h1>Hello.</h1>

<p>My name is Jacob Cook. I'm 26 years old and I currently live in Montréal, Québec, Canada. My areas of professional interest are software engineering, systems administration, web development, digital rights and writing/journalism. 👋</p>

<h3>I'm a web developer, passionate about creating quality software with a purpose.</h3>

<p>I am the lead developer and project manager for <a href="https://arkos.io">arkOS</a>, a project designed to make self-hosting common Web services easy for the general public. arkOS advocates for a freer, more secure, and notably a more decentralized Internet for everyone, and provides technical and educational assistance to further these ends. My work on this project has been featured in many leading media sites, such as VentureBeat, FastCompany, Der Spiegel, Heise and others. I'm also the founder and entrepreneur behind <a href="https://skylark.cloud">Skylark</a>, a hosted version of arkOS that aims to be the privacy-respecting personal cloud of the future. ☁️</p>

<h3>I'm also a bike-rider, an explorer, a music lover, an amateur photographer, and more.</h3>

<p>I enjoy reading and writing about life, technology, politics, the environment, and media studies. The blog on this site primarily serves as an outlet for hashing out my thoughts in these areas. At least for the things that can't be contained in a <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}">tweet</a> or a <a href="https://mastodon.social/users/{{ site.mastodon }}">toot</a>. 📣</p>

<p>I attended Concordia University in the pursuit of a Bachelor of Sciences in Political Science and the French language. My other interests include cycling, photography, film and media studies, travelling, reading, video games and electronic music. 🎵</p>
